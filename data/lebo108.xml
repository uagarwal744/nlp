<p>Biology is the youngest of the formalised disciplines of natural
</p>
<p>science. Progress in physics and chemistry proceeded much
</p>
<p>faster than in Biology. Applications of physics and chemistry in
</p>
<p>our daily life also have a higher visibility than those of biology.
</p>
<p>However, twentieth century and certainly twenty-first century
</p>
<p>has demonstrated the utility of biological knowledge in
</p>
<p>furthering human welfare, be it in health sector or agriculture.
</p>
<p>The discovery of antibiotics, and synthetic plant-derived drugs,
</p>
<p>anaesthetics have changed medical practice on one hand
</p>
<p>and human health on the other hand. Life expectancy of
</p>
<p>human beings have dramatically changed over the years.
</p>
<p>Agricultural practices, food processing and diagnostics have
</p>
<p>brought socio-cultural changes in human communities. These

<p>Born in August 1925 in Kumbakonam in Tamil Nadu, Monkambu Sambasivan
</p>
<p>Swaminathan did his graduation and post-graduation in Botany from
</p>
<p>Madras University. He worked in different capacities in large number of
</p>
<p>institutions in India and abroad and developed his expertise in genetics
</p>
<p>and plant breeding.
</p>
<p>The School of Cytogenetics and Radiation Research established at the
</p>
<p>Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) enabled Swaminathan and his
</p>
<p>team to develop short-duration high-yielding varieties of rice including scented
</p>
<p>Basmati. He is also known for the development of the concept of crop
</p>
<p>cafeteria, crop scheduling and genetically improving the yield and quality.
</p>
<p>Swaminathan initiated collaboration with Norman Borlaug, which
</p>
<p>culminated in the ‘Green Revolution’ through introduction of Mexican
</p>
<p>varieties of wheat in India. This was highly recognised and appreciated. He
</p>
<p>is also the initiator of ‘Lab-to-Land’, food security and several other
</p>
<p>environmental programmes. He has been honoured with Padma Bhushan
</p>
<p>and several other prestigious awards, medals and fellowships by institutions

<p>Health, for a long time, was considered as a state of body
</p>
<p>and mind where there was a balance of certain ‘humors’.
</p>
<p>This is what early Greeks like Hippocrates as well as
</p>
<p>Indian Ayurveda system of medicine asserted. It was
</p>
<p>thought that persons with ‘blackbile’ belonged to hot
</p>
<p>personality and would have fevers. This idea was arrived
</p>
<p>at by pure reflective thought. The discovery of blood
</p>
<p>circulation by William Harvey using experimental method
</p>
<p>and the demonstration of normal body temperature in
</p>
<p>persons with blackbile using thermometer disproved the
</p>
<p>‘good humor’ hypothesis of health. In later years, biology
</p>
<p>stated that mind influences, through neural system and
</p>
<p>endocrine system, our immune system and that our
</p>
<p>immune system maintains our health. Hence, mind and
</p>
<p>mental state can affect our health. Of course, health is
</p>
<p>affected by –
</p>
<p>(i) genetic disorders – deficiencies with which a child is
</p>
<p>born and deficiencies/defects which the child inherits
</p>
<p>from parents from birth;
</p>
<p>(ii) infections  and
</p>
<p>(iii) life style including food and water we take, rest and
</p>
<p>exercise we give to our bodies, habits that we have or
</p>
<p>lack etc.

</p>
<p>BIOLOGY
</p>
<p>The term health is very frequently used by everybody. How do we
</p>
<p>define it? Health does not simply mean ‘absence of disease’ or ‘physical
</p>
<p>fitness’. It could be defined as a state of complete physical, mental and
</p>
<p>social well-being. When people are healthy, they are more efficient at
</p>
<p>work. This increases productivity and brings economic prosperity. Health
</p>
<p>also increases longevity of people and reduces infant and maternal
</p>
<p>mortality.
</p>
<p>Balanced diet, personal hygiene and regular exercise are very important
</p>
<p>to maintain good health. Yoga has been practised since time immemorial
</p>
<p>to achieve physical and mental health. Awareness about diseases and
</p>
<p>their effect on different bodily functions, vaccination (immunisation)
</p>
<p>against infectious diseases, proper disposal of wastes, control of vectors
</p>
<p>and maintenance of hygienic food and water resources are necessary for
</p>
<p>achieving good health.
</p>
<p>When the functioning of one or more organs or systems of the body is
</p>
<p>adversely affected, characterised by various signs and symptoms, we say
</p>
<p>that we are not healthy, i.e., we have a disease. Diseases can be broadly
</p>
<p>grouped into infectious and non-infectious. Diseases which are easily
</p>
<p>transmitted from one person to another, are called infectious diseases.
</p>
<p>Infectious diseases are very common and every one of us suffers from
</p>
<p>these at sometime or other. Some of the infectious diseases like AIDS are
</p>
<p>fatal. Among non-infectious diseases, cancer is the major cause of death.
</p>
<p>Drug and alcohol abuse also affect our health adversely.
</p>
<p>8.1 COMMON DISEASES IN HUMANS
</p>
<p>A wide range of organisms belonging to bacteria, viruses, fungi,
</p>
<p>protozoans, helminths, etc., could cause diseases in man. Such disease-
</p>
<p>causing organisms are called pathogens. Most parasites are therefore
</p>
<p>pathogens as they cause harm to the host by living in (or on) them. The
</p>
<p>pathogens can enter our body by various means, multiply  and interfere
</p>
<p>with normal vital activities, resulting in morphological and functional
</p>
<p>damage. Pathogens have to adapt to life within the environment of the
</p>
<p>host. For example, the pathogens that enter the gut must know a way of
</p>
<p>surviving in the stomach at low pH and resisting the various digestive
</p>
<p>enzymes. A few representative members from different groups of
</p>
<p>pathogenic organisms are discussed here alongwith the diseases caused
</p>
<p>by them. Preventive and control measures against these diseases in general,
</p>
<p>are also briefly described.
</p>
<p>Salmonella typhi is a pathogenic bacterium which causes typhoid
</p>
<p>fever in human beings. These pathogens generally enter the small intestine
</p>
<p>through food and water contaminated with them and migrate to other
</p>
<p>organs through blood. Sustained high fever (39° to 40°C), weakness,
</p>
<p>stomach pain, constipation, headache and loss of appetite are some of
</p>
<p>the  common symptoms of this disease. Intestinal perforation and death
</p>
<p>may occur in severe cases. Typhoid fever could be confirmed by

</p>
<p>Widal test. A classic case in medicine, that of Mary Mallon nicknamed
</p>
<p>Typhoid Mary, is worth mentioning here. She was a cook by profession
</p>
<p>and  was a typhoid carrier who continued to spread typhoid for several
</p>
<p>years through the food she prepared.
</p>
<p>Bacteria like Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae
</p>
<p>are responsible for the disease pneumonia in humans which infects the
</p>
<p>alveoli (air filled sacs) of the lungs. As a result of the infection, the alveoli
</p>
<p>get filled with fluid leading to severe problems in respiration. The symptoms
</p>
<p>of pneumonia include fever, chills, cough and headache. In severe cases,
</p>
<p>the lips and finger nails may turn gray to bluish in colour.  A healthy
</p>
<p>person acquires the infection by inhaling the droplets/aerosols released
</p>
<p>by an infected person or even by sharing glasses and utensils with an
</p>
<p>infected person.  Dysentery, plague, diphtheria, etc., are some of the other
</p>
<p>bacterial diseases in man.
</p>
<p>Many viruses also cause diseases in human beings. Rhino viruses
</p>
<p>represent one such group of viruses which cause one of the most infectious
</p>
<p>human ailments – the common cold.  They infect the nose and respiratory
</p>
<p>passage but not the lungs. The common cold is characterised by nasal
</p>
<p>congestion and discharge, sore throat, hoarseness, cough, headache,
</p>
<p>tiredness, etc., which usually last for 3-7 days. Droplets resulting from
</p>
<p>cough or sneezes of an infected person are either inhaled directly or
</p>
<p>transmitted through contaminated objects such as pens, books, cups,
</p>
<p>doorknobs, computer keyboard or mouse, etc., and cause infection in a
</p>
<p>healthy person.
</p>
<p>Some of the human diseases are caused by protozoans too. You might
</p>
<p>have heard about malaria, a disease man has been fighting since many
</p>
<p>years. Plasmodium, a tiny protozoan is responsible for this disease. Different
</p>
<p>species of Plasmodium (P. vivax, P. malaria and P. falciparum) are
</p>
<p>responsible for different types of malaria. Of these, malignant malaria caused
</p>
<p>by Plasmodium falciparum is the most serious one and can even be fatal.
</p>
<p>Let us take a glance at the life cycle of Plasmodium (Figure 8.1).
</p>
<p>Plasmodium enters the human body as sporozoites (infectious form)
</p>
<p>through the bite of infected female Anopheles mosquito. The parasites
</p>
<p>initially multiply within the liver cells and then attack the red blood cells
</p>
<p>(RBCs) resulting in their rupture. The rupture of RBCs is associated with
</p>
<p>release of a toxic substance, haemozoin, which is responsible for the chill
</p>
<p>and high fever recurring every three to four days. When a female Anopheles
</p>
<p>mosquito bites an infected person, these parasites enter the mosquito’s
</p>
<p>body and undergo further development. The parasites multiply within
</p>
<p>them to form sporozoites that are stored in their salivary glands. When
</p>
<p>these mosquitoes bite a human, the sporozoites are introduced into his/
</p>
<p>her body, thereby initiating the events mentioned above. It is interesting
</p>
<p>to note that the malarial parasite requires two hosts – human and
</p>
<p>mosquitoes – to complete its life cycle (Figure 8.1); the female Anopheles
</p>
<p>mosquito is the vector (transmitting agent) too.

<p>Entamoeba histolytica is a protozoan parasite in the large intestine of
</p>
<p>human which causes amoebiasis (amoebic dysentery). Symptoms  of
</p>
<p>this disease include constipation, abdominal pain and cramps, stools
</p>
<p>with excess mucous and blood clots. Houseflies act as mechanical carriers
</p>
<p>and serve to transmit the parasite from faeces of infected person to food

</p>
<p>and food products, thereby contaminating them.
</p>
<p>Drinking water and food contaminated by the faecal
</p>
<p>matter are the main source of infection.
</p>
<p>Ascaris, the common round worm and Wuchereria,
</p>
<p>the filarial worm, are some of the helminths which are
</p>
<p>known to be pathogenic to man. Ascaris, an intestinal
</p>
<p>parasite causes ascariasis. Symptoms of these disease
</p>
<p>include internal bleeding, muscular pain, fever, anemia
</p>
<p>and blockage of the intestinal passage. The eggs of the
</p>
<p>parasite are excreted along with the faeces of infected
</p>
<p>persons which contaminate soil, water, plants, etc. A
</p>
<p>healthy person acquires this infection through
</p>
<p>contaminated water, vegetables, fruits, etc.
</p>
<p>Wuchereria (W. bancrofti and W. malayi), the filarial
</p>
<p>worms cause a slowly developing chronic inflammation
</p>
<p>of the organs in which they live for many years, usually
</p>
<p>the lymphatic vessels of the lower limbs and the disease
</p>
<p>is called elephantiasis or filariasis (Figure 8.2). The
</p>
<p>genital organs are also often affected, resulting in gross
</p>
<p>deformities. The pathogens are transmitted to a healthy
</p>
<p>person through the bite by the female mosquito vectors.
</p>
<p>Many fungi belonging to the  genera Microsporum,
</p>
<p>Trichophyton and Epidermophyton are
</p>
<p>responsible for ringworms which is one of
</p>
<p>the most common infectious diseases in man.
</p>
<p>Appearance of dry, scaly lesions on various
</p>
<p>parts of the body such as skin, nails and
</p>
<p>scalp (Figure 8.3) are the main symptoms of
</p>
<p>the disease.  These lesions are accompanied
</p>
<p>by intense itching. Heat and moisture help
</p>
<p>these fungi to grow, which makes them thrive
</p>
<p>in skin folds such as those in the groin or
</p>
<p>between the toes. Ringworms are generally
</p>
<p>acquired from soil or by using towels, clothes
</p>
<p>or even the comb of infected individuals.

</p>
<p>Maintenance of personal and public hygiene is very important for
</p>
<p>prevention and control of many infectious diseases. Measures for personal
</p>
<p>hygiene include keeping the body clean; consumption of clean drinking
</p>
<p>water, food, vegetables, fruits, etc. Public hygiene includes proper disposal
</p>
<p>of waste and excreta; periodic cleaning and disinfection of water reservoirs,
</p>
<p>pools, cesspools and tanks and observing standard practices of hygiene
</p>
<p>in public catering. These measures are particularly essential where the
</p>
<p>infectious agents are transmitted through food and water such as typhoid,
</p>
<p>amoebiasis and ascariasis. In cases of air-borne diseases such as
</p>
<p>pneumonia and common cold, in addition to the above measures, close

<p>BIOLOGY
</p>
<p>contact with the infected persons or their belongings should be avoided.
</p>
<p>For diseases such as malaria and filariasis that are transmitted through
</p>
<p>insect vectors, the most important measure is to control or eliminate the
</p>
<p>vectors and their breeding places. This can be achieved by avoiding
</p>
<p>stagnation of water in and around residential areas, regular cleaning of
</p>
<p>household coolers, use of mosquito nets, introducing fishes like Gambusia
</p>
<p>in ponds that feed on mosquito larvae, spraying of insecticides in ditches,
</p>
<p>drainage areas and swamps, etc. In addition, doors and windows should
</p>
<p>be provided with wire mesh to prevent the entry of mosquitoes. Such
</p>
<p>precautions have become all the more important especially in the light of
</p>
<p>recent widespread incidences of the vector-borne (Aedes mosquitoes)
</p>
<p>diseases like dengue and chikungunya in many parts of India.
</p>
<p>The advancements made in biological science have armed us to
</p>
<p>effectively deal with many infectious diseases. The use of vaccines and
</p>
<p>immunisation programmes have enabled us to completely eradicate a
</p>
<p>deadly disease like smallpox. A large number of other infectious diseases
</p>
<p>like polio, diphtheria, pneumonia and tetanus have been controlled to a
</p>
<p>large extent by the use of vaccines. Biotechnology (about which you will
</p>
<p>read more in Chapter 12) is at the verge of making available newer and
</p>
<p>safer vaccines. Discovery of antibiotics and various other drugs has also
</p>
<p>enabled us to effectively treat infectious diseases.
</p>
<p>8.2 IMMUNITY
</p>
<p>Everyday we are exposed to large number of infectious agents. However,
</p>
<p>only a few of these exposures result in disease. Why?  This is due to the
</p>
<p>fact that the body is able to defend itself from most of these foreign agents.
</p>
<p>This overall ability of the host to fight the disease-causing organisms,
</p>
<p>conferred by the immune system is called immunity.
</p>
<p>Immunity is of two types:  (i) Innate immunity  and (ii) Acquired
</p>
<p>immunity.
</p>
<p>8.2.1 Innate Immunity
</p>
<p>Innate immunity is non-specific type of defence, that is present at the
</p>
<p>time of birth. This is accomplished by providing different types of barriers
</p>
<p>to the entry of the foreign agents into our body. Innate immunity consist
</p>
<p>of four types of barriers. These are —
</p>
<p>(i) Physical barriers : Skin on our body is the main barrier which
</p>
<p>prevents entry of the micro-organisms. Mucus coating of the
</p>
<p>epithelium lining the respiratory, gastrointestinal and urogenital
</p>
<p>tracts also help in trapping microbes entering our body.
</p>
<p>(ii) Physiological barriers : Acid in the stomach, saliva in the mouth,
</p>
<p>tears from eyes–all prevent microbial growth.
</p>
<p>(iii) Cellular barriers : Certain types of leukocytes (WBC) of our body
</p>
<p>like polymorpho-nuclear leukocytes (PMNL-neutrophils) and
</p>
<p>2015-16</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>HUMAN HEALTH AND DISEASE
</p>
<p>151
</p>
<p>monocytes and natural killer (type of lymphocytes) in the blood as
</p>
<p>well as macrophages in tissues can phagocytose and destroy
</p>
<p>microbes.
</p>
<p>(iv) Cytokine barriers : Virus-infected cells secrete proteins called
</p>
<p>interferons which protect non-infected cells from further viral infection.
</p>
<p>8.2.2 Acquired Immunity
</p>
<p>Acquired immunity, on the other hand, is pathogen specific. It is
</p>
<p>characterised by memory. This means that our body when it encounters
</p>
<p>a pathogen for the first time produces a response called primary response
</p>
<p>which is of low intensity. Subsequent encounter with the same pathogen
</p>
<p>elicits a highly intensified secondary or anamnestic response. This
</p>
<p>is ascribed to the fact that our body appears to have memory of the
</p>
<p>first encounter.
</p>
<p>The primary and secondary
</p>
<p>immune responses are carried
</p>
<p>out with the help of two
</p>
<p>special types of lymphocytes
</p>
<p>present in our blood,
</p>
<p>i.e., B-lymphocytes and T-
</p>
<p>lymphocytes.The B-lymphocytes
</p>
<p>produce an army of proteins in
</p>
<p>response to pathogens into our
</p>
<p>blood to fight with them. These
</p>
<p>proteins are called antibodies.
</p>
<p>The T-cells themselves do not
</p>
<p>secrete antibodies but help B
</p>
<p>cells produce them. Each
</p>
<p>antibody molecule has four
</p>
<p>peptide chains, two small called
</p>
<p>light chains and two longer
</p>
<p>called heavy chains. Hence, an
</p>
<p>antibody is represented as H
2
L
</p>
<p>2
.
</p>
<p>Different types of antibodies are
</p>
<p>produced in our body. IgA, IgM, IgE, IgG are some of them. A cartoon of
</p>
<p>an antibody is given in Figure 8.4. Because these antibodies are found in
</p>
<p>the blood, the response is also called as humoral immune response.
</p>
<p>This is one of the two types of our acquired immune response – antibody
</p>
<p>mediated. The second type is called cell-mediated immune response or
</p>
<p>cell-mediated immunity (CMI). The T-lymphocytes mediate CMI. Very
</p>
<p>often, when some human organs like heart, eye, liver, kidney fail to function
</p>
<p>satisfactorily, transplantation is  the only remedy to enable the patient to
</p>
<p>live a normal life. Then a search begins – to find a suitable donor. Why is
</p>
<p>it that the organs cannot be taken from just anybody? What is it that

</p>
<p>the doctors check? Grafts from just any source – an animal, another
</p>
<p>primate, or any human beings  cannot be made since the grafts would be
</p>
<p>rejected sooner or later. Tissue matching, blood group matching are
</p>
<p>essential before undertaking any graft/transplant and even after this the
</p>
<p>patient has to take immuno–suppresants all his/her life. The body is able
</p>
<p>to differentiate ‘self ’ and ‘nonself’ and the cell-mediated immune response
</p>
<p>is responsible for the graft rejection.
</p>
<p>8.2.3 Active and Passive Immunity
</p>
<p>When a host is exposed to antigens, which may be in the form of living
</p>
<p>or dead microbes or other proteins, antibodies are produced in the host
</p>
<p>body. This type of immunity is called active immunity. Active immunity
</p>
<p>is slow and takes time to give its full effective response. Injecting the
</p>
<p>microbes deliberately during immunisation or infectious organisms
</p>
<p>gaining access into body during natural infection induce active
</p>
<p>immunity. When ready-made antibodies are directly given to protect
</p>
<p>the body against foreign agents, it is called passive immunity. Do you
</p>
<p>know why mother’s milk is considered very essential for the new-
</p>
<p>born infant? The yellowish fluid colostrum secreted by mother during
</p>
<p>the initial days of lactation has abundant antibodies (IgA) to protect the
</p>
<p>infant. The foetus also receives some antibodies from their mother,
</p>
<p>through the placenta during pregnancy.  These are some examples of
</p>
<p>passive immunity.
</p>
<p>8.2.4 Vaccination and Immunisation
</p>
<p>The principle of immunisation or vaccination is based on the property of
</p>
<p>‘memory’ of the immune system. In vaccination, a preparation of antigenic
</p>
<p>proteins of pathogen or inactivated/weakened pathogen (vaccine) are
</p>
<p>introduced into the body. The antibodies produced in the body against
</p>
<p>these antigens would neutralise the pathogenic agents during actual
</p>
<p>infection. The vaccines also generate memory – B and T-cells that recognise
</p>
<p>the pathogen quickly on subsequent exposure and overwhelm the
</p>
<p>invaders with a massive production of antibodies. If a person is infected
</p>
<p>with some deadly microbes to which quick immune response is required
</p>
<p>as in tetanus, we need to directly inject the preformed antibodies, or
</p>
<p>antitoxin (a preparation containing antibodies to the toxin). Even in cases
</p>
<p>of snakebites, the injection which is given to the patients, contain preformed
</p>
<p>antibodies against the snake venom. This type of immunisation is called
</p>
<p>passive immunisation.
</p>
<p>Recombinant DNA technology has allowed the production of antigenic
</p>
<p>polypeptides of pathogen in bacteria or yeast. Vaccines produced using
</p>
<p>this approach allow large scale production and hence greater availability
</p>
<p>for immunisation, e.g., hepatitis B vaccine produced from yeast.

<p>HUMAN HEALTH AND DISEASE
</p>

</p>
<p>8.2.5 Allergies
</p>
<p>When you have gone to a new place and suddenly you started sneezing,
</p>
<p>wheezing for no explained reason, and when you went away, your
</p>
<p>symptoms dissappeared. Did this happen to you?  Some of us are sensitive
</p>
<p>to some particles in the environment. The above-mentioned reaction could
</p>
<p>be because of allergy to pollen, mites, etc., which are different in different
</p>
<p>places.
</p>
<p>The exaggerated response of the immune system to certain antigens
</p>
<p>present in the environment is called allergy. The substances to which
</p>
<p>such an immune response is produced are called allergens. The antibodies
</p>
<p>produced to these are of IgE type. Common examples of allergens are
</p>
<p>mites in dust, pollens, animal dander, etc. Symptoms of allergic reactions
</p>
<p>include sneezing, watery eyes, running nose and difficulty in breathing.
</p>
<p>Allergy is due to the release of chemicals like histamine and serotonin
</p>
<p>from the mast cells. For determining the cause of allergy, the patient is
</p>
<p>exposed to or injected with very small doses of possible allergens, and the
</p>
<p>reactions studied. The use of drugs like anti-histamine, adrenalin and
</p>
<p>steroids quickly reduce the symptoms of allergy. Somehow, modern-day
</p>
<p>life style has resulted in lowering of immunity and more sensitivity to
</p>
<p>allergens – more and more children in metro cities of India suffer from
</p>
<p>allergies and asthma due to sensitivity to the environment. This could be
</p>
<p>because of the protected environment provided early in life.
</p>
<p>8.2.6 Auto Immunity
</p>
<p>Memory-based acquired immunity evolved in higher vertebrates based
</p>
<p>on the ability to differentiate foreign organisms (e.g., pathogens) from self-
</p>
<p>cells. While we still do not understand the basis of this, two corollaries of
</p>
<p>this ability have to be understood. One, higher vertebrates can distinguish
</p>
<p>foreign molecules as well as foreign organisms. Most of the experimental
</p>
<p>immunology deals with this aspect. Two, sometimes, due to genetic and
</p>
<p>other unknown reasons, the body attacks self-cells. This results in damage
</p>
<p>to the body and is called auto-immune disease. Rheumatoid arthritis
</p>
<p>which affects many people in our society is an auto-immune disease.
</p>
<p>8.2.7 Immune System in the Body
</p>
<p>The human immune system consists of lymphoid organs, tissues, cells
</p>
<p>and soluble molecules like antibodies.  As you have read, immune system
</p>
<p>is unique in the sense that it recognises foreign antigens, responds to
</p>
<p>these and remembers them. The immune system also plays an important
</p>
<p>role in allergic reactions, auto-immune diseases and organ
</p>
<p>transplantation.
</p>
<p>Lymphoid organs: These are the organs where origin and/or maturation
</p>
<p>and proliferation of lymphocytes occur. The primary lymphoid organs
</p>
<p>are bone marrow and thymus where immature lymphocytes differentiate
</p>
<p>2015-16</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>154
</p>
<p>BIOLOGY
</p>
<p>into antigen-sensitive lymphocytes. After maturation the
</p>
<p>lymphocytes migrate to secondary lymphoid organs like spleen,
</p>
<p>lymph nodes, tonsils, Peyer’s patches of small intestine and
</p>
<p>appendix. The secondary lymphoid organs provide the sites for
</p>
<p>interaction of lymphocytes with the antigen, which then proliferate
</p>
<p>to become effector cells. The location of various lymphoid organs
</p>
<p>in the human body is shown in Figure 8.5.
</p>
<p>The bone marrow is the main lymphoid organ where all
</p>
<p>blood cells including lymphocytes are produced. The thymus
</p>
<p>is a lobed organ located near the heart and beneath the
</p>
<p>breastbone. The thymus is quite large at the time of birth but
</p>
<p>keeps reducing in size with age and by the time puberty is
</p>
<p>attained it reduces to a very small size. Both bone-marrow
</p>
<p>and thymus provide micro-environments for the development
</p>
<p>and maturation of T-lymphocytes. The spleen is a large bean-
</p>
<p>shaped organ. It mainly contains lymphocytes and phagocytes.
</p>
<p>It acts as a filter of the blood by trapping blood-borne micro-
</p>
<p>organisms. Spleen also has a large reservoir of erythrocytes.
</p>
<p>The lymph nodes are small solid structures located at different
</p>
<p>points along the lymphatic system. Lymph nodes serve to trap the
</p>
<p>micro-organisms or other antigens, which happen to get into the lymph
</p>
<p>and tissue fluid. Antigens trapped in the lymph nodes are responsible for
</p>
<p>the activation of lymphocytes present there and cause the immune
</p>
<p>response.
</p>
<p>There is lymphoid tissue also located within the lining of the major
</p>
<p>tracts (respiratory, digestive and urogenital tracts) called mucosa-
</p>
<p>associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). It constitutes about 50 per cent of
</p>
<p>the lymphoid tissue in human body.
</p>
<p>8.3 AIDS
</p>
<p>The word AIDS stands for Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome.
</p>
<p>This means deficiency of immune system, acquired during the lifetime of
</p>
<p>an individual indicating that it is not a congenital disease. ‘Syndrome’
</p>
<p>means a group of symptoms. AIDS was first reported in 1981 and in the
</p>
<p>last twenty-five years or so, it has spread all over the world killing more
</p>
<p>than 25 million persons.
</p>
<p>AIDS is caused by the Human Immuno deficiency Virus (HIV), a
</p>
<p>member of a group of viruses called retrovirus, which have an envelope
</p>
<p>enclosing the RNA genome (Figure 8.6). Transmission of HIV-infection
</p>
<p>generally occurs by (a) sexual contact with infected person, (b) by
</p>
<p>transfusion of contaminated blood and blood products, (c) by sharing
</p>
<p>infected needles as in the case of intravenous drug abusers and (d) from
</p>
<p>infected mother to her child through placenta. So, people who are at high
</p>
<p>risk of getting this infection includes - individuals who have multiple

<p>infected mother. Do you know–when do people need repeated blood
</p>
<p>transfusion? Find out and make a list of such conditions. It is important
</p>
<p>to note that HIV/AIDS is not spread by mere touch or physical contact; it
</p>
<p>spreads only through body fluids. It is, hence, imperative, for the physical
</p>
<p>and psychological well-being, that the HIV/AIDS infected persons are
</p>
<p>not isolated from family and society. There is always a time-lag between
</p>
<p>the infection and appearance of AIDS symptoms. This period may vary
</p>
<p>from a few months to many years  (usually 5-10 years).

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>156
</p>
<p>BIOLOGY
</p>
<p>After getting into the body of the person, the virus enters into macrophages
</p>
<p>where RNA genome of the virus replicates to form viral DNA with the help of
</p>
<p>the enzyme reverse transcriptase. This viral DNA gets incorporated into host
</p>
<p>cell’s DNA and directs the infected cells to produce virus particles (Figure 8.6).
</p>
<p>The macrophages continue to produce virus and in this way acts like a HIV
</p>
<p>factory. Simultaneously, HIV enters into helper
</p>
<p>T-lymphocytes (T
H
), replicates and produce progeny viruses. The progeny
</p>
<p>viruses released in the blood attack other helper T-lymphocytes. This is
</p>
<p>repeated leading to a progressive decrease in the number of helper T-
</p>
<p>lymphocytes in the body of the infected person. During this period, the person
</p>
<p>suffers from bouts of fever, diarrhoea and weight loss. Due to decrease in
</p>
<p>the number of helper T lymphocytes, the person starts suffering from infections
</p>
<p>that could have been otherwise overcome such as those due to bacteria
</p>
<p>especially Mycobacterium, viruses, fungi and even parasites like Toxoplasma.
</p>
<p>The patient becomes so immuno-deficient that he/she is unable to protect
</p>
<p>himself/herself against these infections. A widely used diagnostic test for
</p>
<p>AIDS is enzyme linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA). Treatment of AIDS
</p>
<p>with anti-retroviral drugs is only partially effective. They can only prolong
</p>
<p>the life of the patient but cannot prevent death, which is inevitable.
</p>
<p>Prevention of AIDS : As AIDS has no cure, prevention is the best option.
</p>
<p>Moreover, HIV infection, more often, spreads due to conscious behaviour
</p>
<p>patterns and is not something that happens inadvertently, like pneumonia
</p>
<p>or typhoid. Of course, infection in blood transfusion patients, new-borns
</p>
<p>(from mother) etc., may take place due to poor monitoring. The only excuse
</p>
<p>may be ignorance and it has been rightly said – “don’t die of ignorance”.
</p>
<p>In our country the National AIDS Control Organisation (NACO) and other
</p>
<p>non-governmental organisation (NGOs) are doing a lot to educate people
</p>
<p>about AIDS. WHO has started a number of programmes to prevent the
</p>
<p>spreading of HIV infection. Making blood (from blood banks) safe from
</p>
<p>HIV, ensuring the use of only disposable needles and syringes in public
</p>
<p>and private hospitals and clinics, free distribution of condoms, controlling
</p>
<p>drug abuse, advocating safe sex and promoting regular check-ups for
</p>
<p>HIV in susceptible populations, are some such steps taken up.
</p>
<p>Infection with HIV or having AIDS is something that should not be
</p>
<p>hidden – since then, the infection may spread to many more people.
</p>
<p>HIV/AIDS-infected people need help and sympathy instead of being
</p>
<p>shunned by society. Unless society recognises it as a problem to be dealt
</p>
<p>with in a collective manner – the chances of wider spread of the disease
</p>
<p>increase manifold. It is a malady that can only be tackled, by the society
</p>
<p>and medical fraternity acting together, to prevent the spread of the disease.
</p>
<p>8.4 CANCER
</p>
<p>Cancer is one of the most dreaded diseases of human beings and is a major
</p>
<p>cause of death all over the globe. More than a million Indians suffer from
</p>
<p>2015-16</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>HUMAN HEALTH AND DISEASE
</p>
<p>157
</p>
<p>cancer and a large number of them die from it annually. The mechanisms
</p>
<p>that underlie development of cancer or oncogenic transformation of cells,
</p>
<p>its treatment and control have been some of the most intense areas of
</p>
<p>research in biology and medicine.
</p>
<p>In our body, cell growth and differentiation is highly controlled and
</p>
<p>regulated. In cancer cells, there is breakdown of these regulatory
</p>
<p>mechanisms. Normal cells show a property called contact inhibition by
</p>
<p>virtue of which contact with other cells inhibits their uncontrolled growth.
</p>
<p>Cancer cells appears to have lost this property. As a result of this, cancerous
</p>
<p>cells just continue to divide giving rise to masses of cells called tumors.
</p>
<p>Tumors are of two types: benign and malignant. Benign tumors normally
</p>
<p>remain confined to their original location and do not spread to other parts
</p>
<p>of the body and cause little damage. The malignant tumors, on the
</p>
<p>other hand are a mass of proliferating cells called neoplastic or tumor
</p>
<p>cells. These cells grow very rapidly, invading and damaging the
</p>
<p>surrounding normal tissues. As these cells actively divide and grow they
</p>
<p>also starve the normal cells by competing for vital nutrients. Cells sloughed
</p>
<p>from such tumors reach distant sites through blood, and wherever they
</p>
<p>get lodged in the body, they start a new tumor there. This property called
</p>
<p>metastasis is the most feared property of malignant tumors.
</p>
<p>Causes of cancer : Transformation of normal cells into cancerous
</p>
<p>neoplastic cells may be induced by physical, chemical or biological agents.
</p>
<p>These agents are called carcinogens. Ionising radiations like X-rays and
</p>
<p>gamma rays and non-ionizing radiations like UV cause DNA damage
</p>
<p>leading to neoplastic transformation. The chemical carcinogens present
</p>
<p>in tobacco smoke have been identified as a major cause of lung cancer.
</p>
<p>Cancer causing viruses called oncogenic viruses have genes called viral
</p>
<p>oncogenes. Furthermore, several genes called cellular oncogenes
</p>
<p>(c-onc) or proto oncogenes have been identified in normal cells which,
</p>
<p>when activated under certain conditions, could lead to oncogenic
</p>
<p>transformation of the cells.
</p>
<p>Cancer detection and diagnosis : Early detection of cancers is essential
</p>
<p>as it allows the disease to be treated successfully in many cases. Cancer
</p>
<p>detection is based on biopsy and histopathological studies of the tissue
</p>
<p>and blood and bone marrow tests for increased cell counts in the case of
</p>
<p>leukemias. In biopsy, a piece of the suspected tissue cut into thin sections
</p>
<p>is stained and examined under microscope (histopathological studies) by
</p>
<p>a pathologist. Techniques like radiography (use of X-rays), CT (computed
</p>
<p>tomography) and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) are very useful to
</p>
<p>detect cancers of the internal organs. Computed tomography uses X-rays
</p>
<p>to generate a three-dimensional image of the internals of an object. MRI
</p>
<p>uses strong magnetic fields and non-ionising radiations to accurately detect
</p>
<p>pathological and physiological changes in the living tissue.
</p>
<p>Antibodies against cancer-specific antigens are also used for
</p>
<p>detection of certain cancers. Techniques of molecular biology can be

</p>
<p>certain cancers. Identification of such genes, which predispose an
</p>
<p>individual to certain cancers, may be very helpful in prevention of
</p>
<p>cancers. Such individuals may be advised to avoid exposure to
</p>
<p>particular carcinogens to which they are susceptible (e.g., tobacco
</p>
<p>smoke in case of lung cancer).
</p>
<p>Treatment of cancer : The common approaches for treatment of cancer
</p>
<p>are surgery, radiation therapy and immunotherapy. In radiotherapy,
</p>
<p>tumor cells are irradiated lethally, taking proper care of the normal tissues
</p>
<p>surrounding the tumor mass. Several chemotherapeutic drugs are used
</p>
<p>to kill cancerous cells. Some of these are specific for particular tumors.
</p>
<p>Majority of drugs have side effects like hair loss, anemia, etc. Most cancers
</p>
<p>are treated by combination of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
</p>
<p>Tumor cells have been shown to avoid detection and destruction by
</p>
<p>immune system. Therefore, the patients are given substances called
</p>
<p>biological response modifiers such as ααααα-interferon which activates their
</p>
<p>immune system and helps in destroying the tumor.
</p>
<p>8.5 DRUGS AND ALCOHOL ABUSE
</p>
<p>Surveys and statistics show that use of drugs and alcohol has been on
</p>
<p>the rise especially among the youth. This is really a cause of concern as it
</p>
<p>could result in many harmful effects. Proper education and guidance
</p>
<p>would enable youth to safeguard themselves against these dangerous
</p>
<p>behaviour patterns and follow healthy lifestyles.
</p>
<p>The drugs, which are commonly abused are opioids, cannabinoids
</p>
<p>and coca alkaloids. Majority of these are obtained from flowering plants.
</p>
<p>Some are obtained from fungi.
</p>
<p>Opioids are the drugs, which bind to specific opioid receptors present
</p>
<p>in our central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract. Heroin
</p>
<p>(Figure 8.7), commonly called smack is chemically diacetylmorphine which
</p>
<p>is a white, odourless, bitter crystalline compound. This is obtained by
</p>
<p>acetylation of morphine (Figure 8.7), which is extracted from the latex of

<p>poppy plant Papaver somniferum (Figure 8.8). Generally taken by snorting
</p>
<p>and injection, heroin is a depressant and slows down body functions.
</p>
<p>Cannabinoids are a group of chemicals (Figure 8.9), which interact
</p>
<p>with cannabinoid receptors present principally in the brain. Natural
</p>
<p>cannabinoids are obtained from the inflorescences of the plant Cannabis
</p>
<p>sativa (Figure 8.10). The flower tops, leaves and the resin of cannabis
</p>
<p>plant are used in various combinations to produce marijuana,  hashish,
</p>
<p>charas and ganja. Generally taken by inhalation and oral ingestion, these
</p>
<p>are known for their effects on cardiovascular system of the body.

</p>
<p>Coca alkaloid or cocaine is obtained from coca
</p>
<p>plant Erythroxylum coca, native to South America. It
</p>
<p>interferes with the transport of the neuro-transmitter
</p>
<p>dopamine. Cocaine, commonly called coke or crack is
</p>
<p>usually snorted. It has a potent stimulating action on
</p>
<p>central nervous system, producing a sense of euphoria
</p>
<p>and increased energy. Excessive dosage of cocaine
</p>
<p>causes hallucinations. Other well-known plants with
</p>
<p>hallucinogenic properties are Atropa belladona and
</p>
<p>Datura (Figure 8.11). These days cannabinoids are also
</p>
<p>being abused by some sportspersons.
</p>
<p> Drugs like barbiturates, amphetamines,
</p>
<p>benzodiazepines, and other similar drugs, that are
</p>
<p>normally used as medicines to help patients cope with
</p>
<p>mental illnesses like depression and insomnia, are often
</p>
<p>abused. Morphine is a very effective sedative and painkiller, and is very useful
</p>
<p>in patients who have undergone surgery. Several plants,  fruits and seeds
</p>
<p>having hallucinogenic properties have been used for hundreds of years in
</p>
<p>folk-medicine, religious ceremonies and rituals all over the globe. When these
</p>
<p>are taken for a purpose other than medicinal use or in amounts/frequency
</p>
<p>that impairs one’s physical, physiological or psychological functions, it
</p>
<p>constitutes drug abuse.

<p>Smoking also paves the way to hard drugs.  Tobacco has been used
</p>
<p>by human beings for more than 400 years. It is smoked, chewed or used
</p>
<p>as a snuff. Tobacco contains a large number of chemical substances
</p>
<p>including nicotine, an alkaloid. Nicotine stimulates adrenal gland to
</p>
<p>release adrenaline and nor-adrenaline into blood circulation, both of
</p>
<p>which raise blood pressure and increase heart rate. Smoking is associated
</p>
<p>with increased incidence of cancers of lung, urinary bladder and throat,
</p>
<p>bronchitis, emphysema, coronary heart disease, gastric ulcer, etc. Tobacco
</p>
<p>chewing is associated with increased risk of cancer of the oral cavity.
</p>
<p>Smoking increases carbon monoxide (CO) content in blood and reduces
</p>
<p>the concentration of haembound oxygen.  This causes oxygen deficiency
</p>
<p>in the body.
</p>
<p>When one buys packets of cigarettes one cannot miss the statutory
</p>
<p>warning that is present on the packing which warns against smoking
</p>
<p>and says how it is injurious to health. Yet, smoking is very prevalent in
</p>
<p>society, both among young and old. Knowing the dangers of smoking
</p>
<p>and chewing tobacco, and its addictive nature, the youth and old need to
</p>
<p>avoid these habits. Any addict requires counselling and medical help to
</p>
<p>get rid of the habit.
</p>
<p>8.5.1 Adolescence and Drug/Alcohol Abuse
</p>
<p>Adolescence means both ‘a period’ and ‘a process’ during which a child
</p>
<p>becomes mature in terms of his/her attitudes and beliefs for effective
</p>
<p>participation in society. The period between 12-18 years of age may
</p>
<p>be thought of as adolescence period. In other words, adolescence is a
</p>
<p>bridge linking childhood and adulthood. Adolescence is accompanied
</p>
<p>by several biological and behavioural changes. Adolescence, thus is a
</p>
<p>very vulnerable phase of mental and psychological development of an
</p>
<p>individual.
</p>
<p>Curiosity, need for adventure and excitement, and experimentation,
</p>
<p>constitute common causes, which motivate youngsters towards drug
</p>
<p>and alcohol use. A child’s natural curiosity motivates him/her to
</p>
<p>experiment. This is complicated further by effects that might be perceived
</p>
<p>as benefits, of alcohol or drug use. Thus, the first use of drugs or alcohol
</p>
<p>may be out of curiosity or experimentation, but later the child starts
</p>
<p>using these to escape facing problems. Of late, stress, from pressures to
</p>
<p>excel in academics or examinations, has played a significant role in
</p>
<p>persuading the youngsters to try alcohol and drugs. The perception
</p>
<p>among youth that it is ‘cool’ or progressive to smoke, use drugs or
</p>
<p>alcohol, is also in a way a major cause for youth to start these habits.
</p>
<p>Television, movies, newspapers, internet also help to promote this
</p>
<p>perception. Other factors that have been seen to be associated with drug
</p>
<p>and alcohol abuse among adolescents are unstable or unsupportive
</p>
<p>family structures and peer pressure.

<p>8.5.2 Addiction and Dependence
</p>
<p>Because of the perceived benefits, drugs are frequently used repeatedly.
</p>
<p>The most important thing, which one fails to realise, is the inherent
</p>
<p>addictive nature of alcohol and drugs. Addiction is a psychological
</p>
<p>attachment to certain effects –such as euphoria and a temporary feeling
</p>
<p>of well-being – associated with drugs and alcohol. These drive people to
</p>
<p>take them even when these are not needed, or even when their use becomes
</p>
<p>self-destructive. With repeated use of drugs, the tolerance level of the
</p>
<p>receptors present in our body increases. Consequently the receptors
</p>
<p>respond only to higher doses of drugs or alcohol leading to greater intake
</p>
<p>and addiction. However, it should be clearly borne in mind that use of
</p>
<p>these drugs even once, can be a fore-runner to addiction. Thus, the
</p>
<p>addictive potential of drugs and alcohol, pull the user into a vicious circle
</p>
<p>leading to their regular use (abuse) from which he/she may not be able
</p>
<p>to get out. In the absence of any guidance or counselling, the person gets
</p>
<p>addicted and becomes dependent on their use.
</p>
<p>Dependence is the tendency of the body to manifest a characteristic
</p>
<p>and unpleasant withdrawal syndrome if regular dose of drugs/alcohol
</p>
<p>is abruptly discontinued. This is characterised by anxiety, shakiness,
</p>
<p>nausea and sweating, which may be relieved when use is resumed again.
</p>
<p>In some cases, withdrawal symptoms can be severe and even life
</p>
<p>threatening and the person may need medical supervision.
</p>
<p>Dependence leads the patient to ignore all social norms in order to
</p>
<p>get sufficient funds to satiate his/her needs. These result in many social
</p>
<p>adjustment problems.
</p>
<p>8.5.3 Effects of Drug/Alcohol Abuse
</p>
<p>The immediate adverse effects of drugs and alcohol abuse are manifested
</p>
<p>in the form of reckless behaviour, vandalism and violence. Excessive
</p>
<p>doses of drugs may lead to coma and death due to respiratory failure,
</p>
<p>heart failure or cerebral hemorrhage. A combination of drugs or their
</p>
<p>intake along with alcohol generally results in overdosing and even
</p>
<p>deaths. The most common warning signs of drug and alcohol abuse
</p>
<p>among youth include drop in academic performance, unexplained
</p>
<p>absence from school/college, lack of interest in personal hygiene,
</p>
<p>withdrawal, isolation, depression, fatigue, aggressive and rebellious
</p>
<p>behaviour, deteriorating relationships with family and friends, loss of
</p>
<p>interest in hobbies, change in sleeping and eating habits, fluctuations
</p>
<p>in weight, appetite, etc.
</p>
<p>There may even be some far-reaching implications of drug/alcohol
</p>
<p>abuse. If an abuser is unable to get money to buy drugs/alcohol he/she
</p>
<p>may turn to stealing. The adverse effects are just not restricted to the
</p>
<p>person who is using drugs or alcohol. At times, a drug/alcohol addict
</p>
<p>becomes the cause of mental and financial distress to his/her entire family
</p>
<p>and friends.

</p>
<p>BIOLOGY
</p>
<p>Those who take drugs intravenously (direct injection into the vein
</p>
<p>using a needle and syringe), are much more likely to acquire serious
</p>
<p>infections like AIDS and Hepatitis B. The viruses, which are responsible
</p>
<p>for these diseases, are transferred from one person to another by sharing
</p>
<p>of infected needles and syringes. Both AIDS and Hepatitis B infections
</p>
<p>are chronic infections and ultimately fatal. Both can be transmitted
</p>
<p>through sexual contact or infected blood.
</p>
<p>The use of alcohol during adolescence may also have long-term effects.
</p>
<p>It could lead to heavy drinking in adulthood. The chronic use of drugs and
</p>
<p>alcohol damages nervous system and liver (cirrhosis). The use of drugs
</p>
<p>and alcohol during pregnancy is also known to adversely affect the foetus.
</p>
<p>Another misuse of drugs is what certain sportspersons do to enhance
</p>
<p>their performance.  They (mis)use narcotic analgesics, anabolic steroids,
</p>
<p>diuretics and certain hormones in sports to increase muscle strength and
</p>
<p>bulk and to promote aggressiveness and as a result increase athletic
</p>
<p>performance. The side-effects of the use of anabolic steroids in females
</p>
<p>include masculinisation (features like males), increased aggressiveness,
</p>
<p>mood swings, depression, abnormal menstrual cycles, excessive hair
</p>
<p>growth on the face and body, enlargement of clitoris, deepening of voice.
</p>
<p>In males it includes acne, increased aggressiveness, mood swings,
</p>
<p>depression, reduction of size of the testicles, decreased sperm production,
</p>
<p>potential for kidney and liver dysfunction, breast enlargement, premature
</p>
<p>baldness, enlargement of the prostate gland.  These effects may be
</p>
<p>permanent with prolonged use.  In the adolescent male or female, severe
</p>
<p>facial and body acne, and premature closure of the growth centres of the
</p>
<p>long bones may result in stunted growth.
</p>
<p>8.5.4 Prevention and Control
</p>
<p>The age-old adage of ‘prevention is better than cure’ holds true here also.
</p>
<p>It is also true that habits such as smoking, taking drug or alcohol are
</p>
<p>more likely to be taken up at a young age, more during adolescence.
</p>
<p>Hence, it is best to identify the situations that may push an adolescent
</p>
<p>towards use of drugs or alcohol, and to take remedial measures well in
</p>
<p>time. In this regard, the parents and the teachers have a special
</p>
<p>responsibility. Parenting that combines with high levels of nurturance
</p>
<p>and consistent discipline, has been associated with lowered risk of
</p>
<p>substance (alcohol/drugs/tobacco) abuse. Some of the measures
</p>
<p>mentioned here would be particularly useful for prevention and control
</p>
<p>of alcohol and drugs abuse among adolescents
</p>
<p>(i) Avoid undue peer pressure - Every child has his/her own choice
</p>
<p>and personality, which should be respected and nurtured. A child
</p>
<p>should not be pushed unduly to perform beyond his/her threshold
</p>
<p>limits; be it studies, sports or other activities.

<p>HUMAN HEALTH AND DISEASE
</p>
<p>163
</p>
<p>SUMMARY
</p>
<p>Health is not just the absence of disease. It is a state of complete physical,
</p>
<p>mental, social and psychological well-being. Diseases like typhoid,
</p>
<p>cholera, pneumonia, fungal infections of skin, malaria and many others
</p>
<p>are a major cause of distress to human beings. Vector-borne diseases
</p>
<p>like malaria especially one caused by Plasmodium falciparum, if not
</p>
<p>treated, may prove fatal. Besides personal cleanliness and hygiene,
</p>
<p>public health measures like proper disposal of waste, decontamination
</p>
<p>of drinking water, control of vectors like mosquitoes and immunisation
</p>
<p>are very helpful in preventing these diseases. Our immune system plays
</p>
<p>the major role in preventing these diseases when we are exposed to
</p>
<p>disease-causing agents. The innate defences of our body like skin,
</p>
<p>mucous membranes, antimicrobial substances present in our tears,
</p>
<p>saliva and the phagocytic cells help to block the entry of pathogens
</p>
<p>into our body. If the pathogens succeed in gaining entry to our body,
</p>
<p>specific antibodies (humoral immune response) and cells (cell mediated
</p>
<p>immune response) serve to kill these pathogens. Immune system has
</p>
<p>memory. On subsequent exposure to same pathogen, the immune
</p>
<p>response is rapid and more intense. This forms the basis of protection
</p>
<p>(ii) Education and counselling - Educating and counselling him/
</p>
<p>her to face problems and stresses, and to accept disappointments
</p>
<p>and failures as a part of life. It would also be worthwhile to channelise
</p>
<p>the child’s energy into healthy pursuits like sports, reading, music,
</p>
<p>yoga and other extracurricular activities.
</p>
<p>(iii) Seeking help from parents and peers - Help from parents and
</p>
<p>peers should be sought immediately so that they can guide
</p>
<p>appropriately. Help may even be sought from close and trusted
</p>
<p>friends. Besides getting proper advise to sort out their problems,
</p>
<p>this would help young to vent their feelings of anxiety and guilt.
</p>
<p>(iv) Looking for danger signs - Alert parents and teachers need to
</p>
<p>look for and identify the danger signs discussed above. Even friends,
</p>
<p>if they find someone using drugs or alcohol, should not hesitate to
</p>
<p>bring this to the notice of parents or teacher in the best interests of
</p>
<p>the person concerned. Appropriate measures would then be required
</p>
<p>to diagnose the malady and the underlying causes. This would help
</p>
<p>in initiating proper remedial steps or treatment.
</p>
<p>(v) Seeking professional and medical help - A lot of help is available
</p>
<p>in the form of highly qualified psychologists, psychiatrists, and de-
</p>
<p>addiction and rehabilitation programmes to help individuals who
</p>
<p>have unfortunately got in the quagmire of drug/alcohol abuse. With
</p>
<p>such help, the affected individual with sufficient efforts and will power,
</p>
<p>can get rid of the problem completely and lead a perfectly normal
</p>
<p>and healthy life.

<p>BIOLOGY
</p>
<p>afforded by vaccination and immunisation. Among other diseases, AIDS
</p>
<p>and cancer kill a large number of individuals worldwide. AIDS caused
</p>
<p>by the human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV) is fatal but can be
</p>
<p>prevented if certain precautions are taken. Many cancers are curable if
</p>
<p>detected early and appropriate therapeutic measures are taken. Of late,
</p>
<p>drug and alcohol abuse among youth and adolescents is becoming
</p>
<p>another cause of concern. Because of the addictive nature of alcohol
</p>
<p>and drugs, and their perceived benefits like relief from stress, a person
</p>
<p>may try taking these in the face of peer pressure, examinations-related
</p>
<p>and competition-related stresses. In doing so, he/she may get addicted
</p>
<p>to them. Education about their harmful effects, counselling and seeking
</p>
<p>immediate professional and medical help would totally relieve the
</p>
<p>individual from these evils.
