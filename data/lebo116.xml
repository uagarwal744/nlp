<p>Human population size has grown enormously over the
</p>
<p>last hundred years. This means increase in demand for
</p>
<p>food, water, home, electricity, roads, automobiles and
</p>
<p>numerous other commodities. These demands are exerting
</p>
<p>tremendous pressure on our natural resources, and are
</p>
<p>also contributing to pollution of air, water and soil. The
</p>
<p>need of the hour is to check the degradation and depletion
</p>
<p>of our precious natural resources and pollution without
</p>
<p>halting the process of development.
</p>
<p>Pollution is any undesirable change in physical,
</p>
<p>chemical or biological characteristics of air, land, water or
</p>
<p>soil. Agents that bring about such an undesirable change
</p>
<p>are called as pollutants. In order to control environmental
</p>
<p>pollution, the Government of India has passed the
</p>
<p>Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 to protect
</p>
<p>and improve the quality of our environment (air, water
</p>
<p>and soil).
</p>
<p>16.1 AIR POLLUTION AND ITS CONTROL
</p>
<p>We are dependent on air for our respiratory needs.  Air
</p>
<p>pollutants cause injury to all living organisms. They
</p>
<p>reduce growth and yield of crops and cause premature
</p>
<p>death of plants. Air pollutants also deleteriously affect the

<p>ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES
</p>
<p>effects depend on the concentration of pollutants, duration of exposure
</p>
<p>and the organism.
</p>
<p>Smokestacks of thermal power plants, smelters and other industries
</p>
<p>release particulate and gaseous air pollutants together with harmless
</p>
<p>gases, such as nitrogen, oxygen, etc. These pollutants must be separated/
</p>
<p>filtered out before releasing the harmless gases into the atmosphere.
</p>
<p>Figure 16.1 Electrostatic precipitator
</p>
<p>There are several ways of removing particulate matter; the most widely
</p>
<p>used of which is the electrostatic precipitator (Figure 16.1), which can
</p>
<p>remove over 99 per cent particulate matter present in the exhaust from a
</p>
<p>thermal power plant. It has electrode wires that are maintained at several
</p>
<p>thousand volts, which produce a corona that releases electrons. These
</p>
<p>electrons attach to dust particles giving them a net negative charge. The
</p>
<p>collecting plates are grounded and attract the charged dust particles.
</p>
<p>The velocity of air between the plates must be low enough to allow the
</p>
<p>dust to fall. A scrubber (Figure 16.1) can remove gases like sulphur
</p>
<p>dioxide. In a scrubber, the exhaust is passed through a spray of water or
</p>
<p>lime. Recently we have realised the dangers of particulate matter that are
</p>
<p>very very small and are not removed by these precipitators. According to
</p>
<p>Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), particulate size 2.5 micrometers
</p>
<p>or less in diameter (PM 2.5) are responsible for causing the greatest harm
</p>
<p>to human health. These fine particulates can be inhaled deep into the
</p>
<p>lungs and can cause breathing and respiratory symptoms, irritation,
</p>
<p>inflammations and damage to the lungs and premature deaths.

<p>BIOLOGY
</p>
<p>Automobiles are a major cause for atmospheric pollution atleast in
</p>
<p>the metro cities.  As the number of vehicles increase on the streets, this
</p>
<p>problem is now shifting to the other cities too. Proper maintenance of
</p>
<p>automobiles along with use of lead-free petrol or diesel can reduce the
</p>
<p>pollutants they emit. Catalytic converters, having expensive metals namely
</p>
<p>platinum-palladium and rhodium as the catalysts, are fitted into
</p>
<p>automobiles for reducing emission of poisonous gases. As the exhaust
</p>
<p>passes through the catalytic converter, unburnt hydrocarbons are
</p>
<p>converted into carbon dioxide and water, and carbon monoxide and nitric
</p>
<p>oxide are changed to carbon dioxide and nitrogen gas, respectively. Motor
</p>
<p>vehicles equipped with catalytic converter should use unleaded petrol
</p>
<p>because lead in the petrol inactivates the catalyst.
</p>
<p>In India, the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act came
into force in 1981, but was amended in 1987 to include noise as an air
</p>
<p>pollutant. Noise is undesired high level of sound. We have got used to
associating loud sounds with pleasure and entertainment not realising
</p>
<p>that noise causes psychological and physiological disorders in humans.
</p>
<p>The bigger the city, the bigger the function, the greater the noise!!  A
</p>
<p>brief exposure to extremely high sound level, 150 dB or more generated
</p>
<p>by take off of a jet plane or rocket, may damage ear drums thus
</p>
<p>permanently impairing hearing ability. Even chronic exposure to a
</p>
<p>relatively lower noise level of cities may permanently damage hearing
</p>
<p>abilities of humans. Noise also causes sleeplessness, increased heart
</p>
<p>beat, altered breathing pattern, thus considerably stressing humans.
</p>
<p>Considering the many dangerous effects of noise pollution can you
</p>
<p>identify the unnecessary sources of noise pollution around you which
</p>
<p>can be reduced immediately without any financial loss to anybody?
</p>
<p>Reduction of noise in our industries can be affected by use of sound-
</p>
<p>absorbent materials or by muffling noise.  Stringent following of laws laid
</p>
<p>down in relation to noise like delimitation of horn-free zones around
</p>
<p>hospitals and schools,  permissible sound-levels of crackers and of loud-
</p>
<p>speakers, timings after which loudspeakers cannot be played, etc., need
</p>
<p>to be enforced to protect ourselves from noise pollution.

<p>16.1.1 Controlling Vehicular Air Pollution: A Case
Study of Delhi
</p>
<p>With its very large population of vehicular traffic, Delhi leads the coun-
</p>
<p>try in its levels of air-pollution â€“ it has more cars than the states of
</p>
<p>Gujarat and West Bengal put together.  In the 1990s, Delhi ranked
</p>
<p>fourth among the 41 most polluted cities of the world.  Air pollution
</p>
<p>problems in Delhi became so serious that a public interest litigation
</p>
<p>(PIL) was filed in the Supreme Court of India. After being censured very
</p>
<p>strongly by the Supreme Court, under its directives, the government
</p>
<p>was asked to take, within a specified time period, appropriate meas-
</p>
<p>ures, including switching over the entire fleet of public transport, i.e.,
</p>
<p>buses, from diesel to compressed natural gas (CNG).  All the buses of
Delhi were converted to run on CNG by the end of 2002. You may ask
</p>
<p>the question as to why CNG is better than diesel. The answer is that
</p>
<p>2015-16</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>273
</p>
<p>ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES
</p>
<p>CNG burns most efficiently, unlike petrol or diesel, in the automobiles
</p>
<p>and very little of it is left unburnt. Moreover, CNG is cheaper than petrol
</p>
<p>or diesel, cannot be siphoned off by thieves and adulterated like petrol
</p>
<p>or diesel. The main problem with switching over to CNG is the difficulty
</p>
<p>of laying down pipelines to deliver CNG through distribution points/
</p>
<p>pumps and ensuring uninterrupted supply.  Simultaneously parallel
</p>
<p>steps taken in Delhi for reducing vehicular pollution include phasing
</p>
<p>out of old vehicles, use of unleaded petrol, use of low-sulphur petrol
</p>
<p>and diesel, use of catalytic converters in vehicles, application of stringent
</p>
<p>pollution-level norms for vehicles, etc.
</p>
<p>The Government of India through a new auto fuel policy has laid
</p>
<p>out a roadmap to cut down vehicular pollution in Indian cities. More
</p>
<p>stringent norms for fuels means steadily reducing the sulphur and
</p>
<p>aromatic content in petrol and diesel fuels. Euro III norms, for example,
</p>
<p>stipulate that sulphur be controlled at 350 parts-per-million (ppm) in
</p>
<p>diesel and 150 ppm in petrol. Aromatic hydrocarbons are to be contained
</p>
<p>at 42 per cent of the concerned fuel. The goal, according to the roadmap,
</p>
<p>is to reduce sulphur to 50 ppm in petrol and diesel and bring down the
</p>
<p>level to 35 per cent. Corresponding to the fuel, vehicle engines will also
</p>
<p>need to be upgraded.
</p>
<p>Mass Emission Standards (Bharat Stage II which is equivalent to Euro-
</p>
<p>II norms) are no more applicable in any of the cities of India. Details of the
</p>
<p>latest Mass Emission Standards in India are provided below (Table 16.1)

</p>
<p>improved. According to an estimate, a substantial fall in CO

 and SO

<p>level has been found in Delhi between 1997 and 2005.
</p>
<p>16.2  WATER POLLUTION AND ITS CONTROL
</p>
<p>Human beings have been abusing the water-bodies around the world by
</p>
<p>disposing into them all kinds of waste. We tend to believe that water can
</p>
<p>wash away everything not taking cognizance of the fact that the water
</p>
<p>bodies are our lifeline as well as that of all other living organisms. Can
</p>
<p>you list what all we tend to try and wash away through our rivers and
</p>
<p>drains? Due to such activities of human kind, the ponds, lakes, stream,

</p>
<p>BIOLOGY
</p>
<p>rivers, estuaries and oceans are becoming polluted in several parts of the
</p>
<p>world. Realising the importance of maintaining the cleanliness of the water
</p>
<p>bodies, the Government of India has passed the Water (Prevention and
</p>
<p>Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 to safeguard our water resources.
</p>
<p>16.2.1 Domestic Sewage and Industrial Effluents
</p>
<p>As we work with water in our homes in the cities and towns, we wash
</p>
<p>everything into drains.  Have you
</p>
<p>ever wondered where the sewage
</p>
<p>that comes out of our houses go?
</p>
<p>What happens in villages? Is the
</p>
<p>sewage treated before being
</p>
<p>transported to the nearest river
</p>
<p>and mixed with it?  A mere 0.1
</p>
<p>per cent impurities make
</p>
<p>domestic sewage unfit for human
</p>
<p>use (Figure 16.2). You have read
</p>
<p>about sewage treatment
</p>
<p>plants in Chapter 10. Solids are
</p>
<p>relatively easy to remove, what
</p>
<p>is most difficult to remove are

</p>
<p>dissolved salts such as nitrates, phosphates, and other nutrients, and
</p>
<p>toxic metal ions and organic compounds. Domestic sewage primarily
</p>
<p>contains biodegradable organic matter, which readily decomposes â€“
</p>
<p>thanks to bacteria and other micro-organisms, which can multiply using
</p>
<p>these organic substances as substrates and hence utilise some of the
</p>
<p>components of sewage. It is possible to estimate the amount of
</p>
<p>biodegradable organic matter in sewage water by measuring Biochemical
</p>
<p>Oxygen Demand (BOD).  Can you explain how? In the chapter on micro-
</p>
<p>organisms you have read about the relation between BOD, micro-
</p>
<p>organisms and the amount of biodegradable matter.
</p>
<p>Figure 16.3 shows some of the changes that one may notice following
</p>
<p>discharge of sewage into a river. Micro-organisms involved in
</p>
<p>biodegradation of organic matter in the receiving water body consume a
</p>
<p>lot of oxygen, and as a result there is a sharp decline in dissolved oxygen
</p>
<p>downstream from the point of sewage discharge. This causes mortality of
</p>
<p>fish and other aquatic creatures.
</p>
<p>Presence of large amounts of nutrients in waters also causes excessive
</p>
<p>growth of planktonic (free-floating) algae, called an algal bloom
</p>
<p>(Figure 16.4) which imparts a distinct colour to the water bodies. Algal
</p>
<p>blooms cause deterioration of the water quality and fish mortality.  Some
</p>
<p>bloom-forming algae are extremely toxic to human beings and animals.
</p>
<p>You may have seen the beautiful mauve-colored flowers found on
</p>
<p>very appealingly-shaped floating plants in water bodies.  These plants
</p>
<p>which were introduced into India for their lovely flowers have caused havoc
</p>
<p>by their excessive growth by causing blocks in our waterways. They grow
</p>
<p>faster than our ability to remove them. These are plants of water hyacinth
</p>
<p>(Eichhornia crassipes), the worldâ€™s most problematic aquatic weed, also

<p>called â€˜ Terror of Bengal â€™. They grow abundantly in
</p>
<p>eutrophic water bodies, and lead to an imbalance in the
</p>
<p>ecosystem dynamics of the water body.
</p>
<p>Sewage from our homes as well as from hospitals are
</p>
<p>likely to contain many undesirable pathogenic micro-
</p>
<p>organisms, and its disposal into a water  without proper
</p>
<p>treatment may cause outbreak of serious diseases, such
</p>
<p>as, dysentery, typhoid, jaundice, cholera, etc.
</p>
<p>Unlike domestic sewage, waste water from industries
</p>
<p>like petroleum, paper manufacturing, metal extraction and
</p>
<p>processing, chemical manufacturing, etc., often contain
</p>
<p>toxic substances, notably, heavy metals (defined as
</p>
<p>elements with density &gt; 5 g/cm3 such as mercury,
</p>
<p>cadmium, copper, lead, etc.) and a variety of organic
</p>
<p>compounds.
</p>
<p>A few toxic substances, often present in industrial
</p>
<p>waste waters, can undergo biological magnification
</p>
<p>(Biomagnification) in the aquatic food chain.
</p>
<p>Biomagnification refers to increase in concentration of
</p>
<p>the toxicant at successive trophic levels. This happens
</p>
<p>because a toxic substance accumulated by an organism
</p>
<p>cannot be metabolised or excreted, and is thus passed on
</p>
<p>to the next higher trophic level.  This phenomenon is well-
</p>
<p>known for mercury and DDT. Figure 16.5 shows
</p>
<p>biomagnification of DDT in an aquatic food chain. In this
</p>
<p>manner, the concentration of DDT is increased  at
</p>
<p>successive trophic levels; say if it starts at 0.003 ppb
</p>
<p>(ppb = parts per billion) in water, it can ultimately reach
</p>
<p>25 ppm (ppm = parts per million) in fish-eating birds,
</p>
<p>through biomagnification. High concentrations of DDT
</p>
<p>disturb calcium metabolism in birds, which causes
</p>
<p>thinning of eggshell and their premature breaking,
</p>
<p>eventually causing decline in bird populations.
</p>
<p>Eutrophication is the natural aging of a lake by
</p>
<p>nutrient enrichment of its water. In a young lake the water is cold and
</p>
<p>clear, supporting little life. With time, streams draining into the lake
</p>
<p>introduce nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, which encourage
</p>
<p>the growth of aquatic organisms. As the lakeâ€™s fertility increases, plant
</p>
<p>and animal life burgeons, and organic remains begin to be deposited on
</p>
<p>the lake bottom. Over the centuries, as silt and organic debris pile up, the
</p>
<p>lake grows shallower and warmer, with warm-water organisms
</p>
<p>supplanting those that thrive in a cold environment. Marsh plants take
</p>
<p>root in the shallows and begin to fill in the original lake basin. Eventually,
</p>
<p>the lake gives way to large masses of floating plants (bog), finally converting
</p>
<p>into land. Depending on climate, size of the lake and other factors, the

</p>
<p>ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES
</p>
<p>natural aging of a lake may span thousands of years. However, pollutants
</p>
<p>from manâ€™s activities like effluents from the industries and homes can
</p>
<p>radically accelerate the aging process. This phenomenon has been called
</p>
<p>Cultural or Accelerated Eutrophication. During the past century, lakes
</p>
<p>in many parts of the earth have been severely eutrophied by sewage and
</p>
<p>agricultural and industrial wastes. The prime contaminants are nitrates
</p>
<p>and phosphates, which act as plant nutrients. They overstimulate the
</p>
<p>growth of algae, causing unsightly scum and unpleasant odors, and
</p>
<p>robbing the water of dissolved oxygen vital to other aquatic life. At the
</p>
<p>same time, other pollutants flowing into a lake may poison whole
</p>
<p>populations of fish, whose decomposing remains further deplete the
</p>
<p>waterâ€™s dissolved oxygen content. In such fashion, a lake can literally
</p>
<p>choke to death.
</p>
<p>Heated (thermal) wastewaters flowing out of electricity-generating units,
</p>
<p>e.g., thermal power plants, constitute another important category of
</p>
<p>pollutants. Thermal wastewater eliminates or reduces the number of
</p>
<p>organisms sensitive to high temperature, and may enhance the growth of
</p>
<p>plants and fish in extremely cold areas but, only after causing damage to
</p>
<p>the indigenous flora and fauna.
</p>
<p>16.2.2 A Case Study of Integrated Waste Water Treatment
</p>
<p>Wastewater including sewage can be treated in an integrated manner, by
</p>
<p>utilising a mix of artificial and natural processes. An example of such an
</p>
<p>initiative is the town of Arcata, situated along the northern coast of
</p>
<p>California. Collaborating with biologists from the Humboldt
</p>
<p>State University, the townspeople created an integrated waste water
</p>
<p>treatment process within a natural system. The cleaning occurs in two
</p>
<p>stages â€“ (a) the conventional sedimentation, filtering and chlorine
</p>
<p>treatments are given. After this stage, lots of dangerous pollutants like
</p>
<p>dissolved heavy metals still remain. To combat this, an innovative
</p>
<p>approach was taken and (b) the biologists developed a series of six
</p>
<p>connected marshes over 60 hectares of marshland. Appropriate plants,
</p>
<p>algae, fungi and bacteria were seeded into this area, which neutralise,
</p>
<p>absorb and assimilate the pollutants. Hence, as the water flows through
</p>
<p>the marshes, it gets purified naturally.
</p>
<p>The marshes also constitute a sanctuary, with a high level of
</p>
<p>biodiversity in the form of fishes, animals and birds that now reside there.
</p>
<p>A citizens group called Friends of the Arcata Marsh (FOAM) are responsible
</p>
<p>for the upkeep and safeguarding of this wonderful project. .
</p>
<p>All this time, we have assumed that removal of wastes requires water,
</p>
<p>i.e., the creation of sewage. But what if water is not necessary to dispose
</p>
<p>off human waste, like excreta? Can you imagine the amount of water that
</p>
<p>one can save if one didnâ€™t have to flush the toilet? Well, this is already a
</p>
<p>reality. Ecological sanitation is a sustainable system for handling human

<p>BIOLOGY
</p>
<p>excreta, using dry composting toilets. This is a practical, hygienic, efficient
</p>
<p>and cost-effective solution to human waste disposal.  The key point to
</p>
<p>note here is that with this composting method, human excreta can be
</p>
<p>recycled into a resource (as natural fertiliser), which reduces the need for
</p>
<p>chemical fertilisers. There are working â€˜EcoSanâ€™ toilets in many areas of
</p>
<p>Kerala and Sri Lanka.
</p>
<p>16.3 SOLID WASTES
</p>
<p>Solid wastes refer to everything that goes out in trash.  Municipal solid
</p>
<p>wastes are wastes from homes, offices, stores, schools, hospitals, etc.,
</p>
<p>that are collected and disposed by the municipality. The municipal solid
</p>
<p>wastes generally comprise paper, food wastes, plastics, glass, metals,
</p>
<p>rubber, leather, textile, etc. Burning reduces the volume of the wastes,
</p>
<p>although it is generally not burnt to completion and open dumps often
</p>
<p>serve as the breeding ground for rats and flies. Sanitary landfills were
</p>
<p>adopted as the substitute for open-burning dumps. In a sanitary landfill,
</p>
<p>wastes are dumped in a depression or trench after compaction, and
</p>
<p>covered with dirt everyday. If you live in a town or city, do you know
</p>
<p>where the nearest landfill site is? Landfills are also not really much of
</p>
<p>a solution since the amount of garbage generation specially in the metros
</p>
<p>has increased so much that these sites are getting filled too. Also there
</p>
<p>is danger of seepage of chemicals, etc., from these landfills polluting the
</p>
<p>underground water resources.
</p>
<p>A solution to all this can only be in human beings becoming more
</p>
<p>sensitive to these environment issues. All waste that we generate can
</p>
<p>be categorised into three types â€“ (a) bio-degradable, (b) recyclable and
</p>
<p>(c) the non-biodegradable. It is important that all garbage generated is
</p>
<p>sorted. What can be reused or recycled should be separated out; our
</p>
<p>kabadiwallahs and rag-pickers do a great job of separation of materials
</p>
<p>for recycling. The biodegradable materials can be put into deep pits in
</p>
<p>the ground and be left for natural breakdown. That leaves only the non-
</p>
<p>biodegradable to be disposed off . The need to reduce our garbage
</p>
<p>generation should be a prime goal, instead, we are increasing the use of
</p>
<p>non-biodegradable products.  Just pick any readymade packet of any
</p>
<p>â€˜good qualityâ€™ eatable, say a biscuit packet, and study the packaging â€“
</p>
<p>do you see the number of protective layers used? Note that atleast one
</p>
<p>layer is of plastic. We have started packaging even our daily use products
</p>
<p>like milk and water in polybags!! In cities, fruits and vegetables can be
</p>
<p>bought packed in beautiful polysterene and plastic packaging â€“ we pay
</p>
<p>so much and what do we do? Contribute heavily to environmental
</p>
<p>pollution. State Governments across the country are trying to push for
</p>
<p>reduction in use of plastics and use of eco-friendly packaging. We can do
</p>
<p>our bit by carrying cloth or other natural fibre carry-bags when we go
</p>
<p>shopping and by refusing polythene bags.

</p>
<p>ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES
</p>
<p>Hospitals generate hazardous wastes that contain disinfectants and
</p>
<p>other harmful chemicals, and also pathogenic micro-organisms. Such
</p>
<p>wastes also require careful treatment and disposal. The use of incinerators
</p>
<p>is crucial to disposal of hospital waste.
</p>
<p>Irreparable computers and other electronic goods are known as
</p>
<p>electronic wastes (e-wastes). E-wastes are buried in landfills or
</p>
<p>incinerated. Over half of the e-wastes generated in the developed world
</p>
<p>are exported to developing countries, mainly to China, India and Pakistan,
</p>
<p>where metals like copper, iron, silicon, nickel and gold are recovered
</p>
<p>during recycling process. Unlike developed countries, which have
</p>
<p>specifically built facilities for recycling of e-wastes, recycling in developing
</p>
<p>countries often involves manual participation thus exposing workers to
</p>
<p>toxic substances present in e-wastes. Recycling is the only solution for
</p>
<p>the treatment of e-waste, provided it is carried out in an environment-
</p>
<p>friendly manner.
</p>
<p>16.3.1 Case Study of Remedy for Plastic Waste
</p>
<p>A plastic sack manufacturer in Bangalore has managed to find the ideal
</p>
<p>solution to the ever-increasing problem of accumulating plastic waste.
</p>
<p>Ahmed Khan, aged 57 years old, has been producing plastic sacks for
</p>
<p>20 years. About 8 years ago, he realised that plastic waste was a real
</p>
<p>problem. Polyblend, a fine powder of recycled modified plastic, was
</p>
<p>developed then by his company. This mixture is mixed with the bitumen
</p>
<p>that is used to lay roads. In collaboration with R.V.College of Engineering
</p>
<p>and the Bangalore City Corporation, Ahmed Khan proved that blends of
</p>
<p>Polyblend and bitumen, when used to lay roads, enhanced the bitumenâ€™s
</p>
<p>water repellant properties, and helped to increase road life by a factor of
</p>
<p>three. The raw material for creating Polyblend is any plastic film waste.
</p>
<p>So, against the price of Rs. 0.40 per kg that rag pickers had been getting
</p>
<p>for plastic waste, Khan now offers Rs.6. Using Khanâ€™s technique, by the
</p>
<p>year 2002, more than 40 kms of road in Bangalore has already been
</p>
<p>laid. At this rate, Khan will soon be running short of plastic waste in
</p>
<p>Bangalore, to produce Polyblend. Thanks to innovations like Polyblend,
</p>
<p>we might still avoid being smothered by plastic waste.
</p>
<p>16.4 AGRO-CHEMICALS AND THEIR EFFECTS
</p>
<p>In the wake of green revolution, use of inorganic fertilisers and pesticides
</p>
<p>has increased manifold for enhancing crop production. Pesticides,
</p>
<p>herbicides, fungicides, etc., are being increasingly used. These incidentally,
</p>
<p>are also toxic to non-target organisms,that are important components of
</p>
<p>the soil ecosystem. Do you think these can be biomagnified in the terrestrial
</p>
<p>ecosystems?  We know what the addition of increasing amounts of
</p>
<p>chemical fertilisers can do to aquatic ecosystems vis-Ã -vis eutrophication.
</p>
<p>The current problems in agriculture are, therefore, extremely grave.

</p>
<p>16.4.1 Case Study of Organic Farming
</p>
<p>Integrated organic farming is a cyclical, zero-waste procedure, where waste
</p>
<p>products from one process are cycled in as nutrients for other processes.
</p>
<p>This allows the maximum utilisation of resource and increases the
</p>
<p>efficiency of production. Ramesh Chandra Dagar, a farmer in Sonipat,
</p>
<p>Haryana, is doing just this. He includes bee-keeping, dairy management,
</p>
<p>water harvesting, composting and agriculture in a chain of processes,
</p>
<p>which support each other and allow an extremely economical and
</p>
<p>sustainable venture. There is no need to use chemical fertilisers for crops,
</p>
<p>as cattle excreta (dung) are used as manure. Crop waste is used to create
</p>
<p>compost, which can be used as a natural fertiliser or can be used to
</p>
<p>generate natural gas for satisfying the energy needs of the farm.
</p>
<p>Enthusiastic about spreading information and help on the practice of
</p>
<p>integrated organic farming, Dagar has created the Haryana Kisan Welfare
</p>
<p>Club, with a current membership of 5000 farmers.
</p>
<p>16.5 RADIOACTIVE WASTES
</p>
<p>Initially, nuclear energy was hailed as a non-polluting way for generating
</p>
<p>electricity. Later on, it was realised that the use of nuclear energy has two
</p>
<p>very serious inherent problems. The first is accidental leakage, as occurred
</p>
<p>in the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl incidents and the second is safe
</p>
<p>disposal of radioactive wastes.
</p>
<p>Radiation, that is given off by nuclear waste is extremely damaging to
</p>
<p>organisms, because it causes mutations at a very high rate. At high doses,
</p>
<p>nuclear radiation is lethal but at lower doses, it creates various disorders,
</p>
<p>the most frequent of all being cancer. Therefore, nuclear waste is an
</p>
<p>extremely potent pollutant and has to be dealt with utmost caution.
</p>
<p>It has been recommended that storage of nuclear waste, after
</p>
<p>sufficient pre-treatment, should be done in suitably shielded
</p>
<p>containers buried within the rocks, about 500 m deep below the
</p>
<p>earthâ€™s surface. However, this method of disposal is meeting stiff
</p>
<p>opposition from the public. Why do you think this method of
</p>
<p>disposal is not agreeable to many people?
</p>
<p>16.6 GREENHOUSE EFFECT AND GLOBAL WARMING
</p>
<p>The term â€˜Greenhouse effectâ€™ has been derived from a phenomenon that
</p>
<p>occurs in a greenhouse. Have you ever seen a greenhouse? It looks like a
</p>
<p>small glass house and is used for growing plants especially during winter.
</p>
<p>In a greenhouse the glass panel lets the light in, but does not allow heat
</p>
<p>to escape. Therefore, the greenhouse warms up, very much like inside a
</p>
<p>car that has been parked in the sun for a few hours.
</p>
<p>The greenhouse effect  is a naturally occurring phenomenon that is
</p>
<p>responsible for heating of Earthâ€™s surface and atmosphere. You would be

<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>281
</p>
<p>ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES
</p>
<p>surprised to know that without greenhouse effect the average temperature
</p>
<p>at surface of Earth would have been a chilly â€“18oC rather than the present
</p>
<p>average of 15oC. In order to understand the
</p>
<p>greenhouse effect, it is necessary to know the
</p>
<p>fate of the energy of sunlight that reaches the
</p>
<p>outermost atmosphere (Figure16.6). Clouds
</p>
<p>and gases reflect about one-fourth of the
</p>
<p>incoming solar radiation, and absorb some of
</p>
<p>it but almost half of incoming solar radiation
</p>
<p>falls on Earthâ€™s surface heating it, while a small
</p>
<p>proportion is reflected back. Earthâ€™s surface
</p>
<p>re-emits heat in the form of infrared radiation
</p>
<p>but part of this does not escape into space as
</p>
<p>atmospheric gases (e.g., carbon dioxide,
</p>
<p>methane, etc.) absorb a major fraction of it. The
</p>
<p>molecules of these gases radiate heat energy,
</p>
<p>and a major part of which again comes to
</p>
<p>Earthâ€™s surface, thus heating it up once again.
</p>
<p>This cycle is repeated many a times. The
</p>
<p>above-mentioned gases â€“ carbon dioxide and methane â€“ are commonly
</p>
<p>known as greenhouse gases (Figure 16.7) because they are responsible
</p>
<p>for the greenhouse effect.
</p>
<p>Increase in the level of greenhouse gases has led to considerable heating
</p>
<p>of Earth leading to global warming. During the past century, the
</p>
<p>temperature of Earth has increased by 0.6 oC, most of it during the last

<p>three decades. Scientists believe that this rise in temperature is leading
</p>
<p>to deleterious changes in the environment and resulting in odd climatic
</p>
<p>changes (e.g. El Nino effect) , thus leading to increased melting of polar
</p>
<p>ice caps as well as of other places like the Himalayan snow caps. Over
</p>
<p>many years, this will result in a rise in sea level that can submerge many
</p>
<p>coastal areas. The total spectrum of changes that global warming can
</p>
<p>bring about is a subject that is still under active research.
</p>
<p>How can we control global warming? The measures include cutting
</p>
<p>down use of fossil fuel, improving efficiency of energy usage, reducing
</p>
<p>deforestation, planting trees and slowing down the growth of human
</p>
<p>population. International initiatives are also being taken to reduce the
</p>
<p>emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
</p>
<p>16.7 OZONE DEPLETION IN THE STRATO-
</p>
<p>SPHERE
</p>
<p>You have earlier studied in the Chemistry
</p>
<p>textbook of Class XI about â€˜badâ€™ ozone, formed
</p>
<p>in the lower atmosphere (troposphere) that harms
</p>
<p>plants and animals. There is â€˜goodâ€™ ozone also;
</p>
<p>this ozone is found in the upper part of the
</p>
<p>atmosphere called the stratosphere, and it acts
</p>
<p>as a shield absorbing ultraviolet radiation from
</p>
<p>the sun. UV rays are highly injurious to living
</p>
<p>organisms since DNA and proteins of living
</p>
<p>organisms preferentially absorb UV rays, and its
</p>
<p>high energy breaks the chemical bonds within
</p>
<p>these molecules. The thickness of the ozone in a
</p>
<p>column of air from the ground to the top of the
</p>
<p>atmosphere is measured in terms of Dobson
</p>
<p>units (DU).
</p>
<p>Ozone gas is continuously formed by the
</p>
<p>action of UV rays on molecular oxygen, and also
</p>
<p>degraded into molecular oxygen in the
</p>
<p>stratosphere. There should be a balance between
</p>
<p>production and degradation of ozone in the
</p>
<p>stratosphere. Of late, the balance has been
</p>
<p>disrupted due to enhancement of ozone
</p>
<p>degradation by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).
</p>
<p>CFCs find wide use as refrigerants. CFCs discharged in the lower part of
</p>
<p>atmosphere move upward and reach stratosphere. In stratosphere, UV
</p>
<p>rays act on them releasing Cl atoms. Cl degrades ozone releasing
</p>
<p>molecular oxygen, with these atoms acting merely as catalysts; Cl atoms
</p>
<p>are not consumed in the reaction. Hence, whatever CFCs are added to
</p>
<p>the stratosphere, they have permanent and continuing affects on Ozone

</p>
<p>ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES
</p>
<p>levels.  Although ozone depletion is occurring widely in the stratosphere,
</p>
<p>the depletion is particularly marked over the Antarctic region. This has
</p>
<p>resulted in formation of a large area of thinned ozone layer, commonly
</p>
<p>called as the ozone hole (Figure 16.8).
</p>
<p>UV radiation of wavelengths shorter than UV-B, are almost completely
</p>
<p>absorbed by Earthâ€™s atmosphere, given that the ozone layer is intact. But,
</p>
<p>UV-B damages DNA and mutation may occur. It causes aging of skin,
</p>
<p>damage to skin cells and various types of skin cancers. In human eye,
</p>
<p>cornea absorbs UV-B radiation, and a high dose of UV-B causes
</p>
<p>inflammation of cornea, called snow-blindness, cataract, etc. Such
</p>
<p>exposure may permanently damage the cornea.
</p>
<p>Recognising the deleterious affects of ozone depletion, an international
</p>
<p>treaty, known as the Montreal Protocol, was signed at Montreal (Canada)
</p>
<p>in 1987 (effective in 1989) to control the emission of ozone depleting
</p>
<p>substances. Subsequently many more efforts have been made and
</p>
<p>protocols have laid down definite roadmaps, separately for developed and
</p>
<p>developing countries, for reducing the emission of CFCs and other ozone
</p>
<p>depleting chemicals.
</p>
<p>16.8 DEGRADATION BY IMPROPER RESOURCE UTILISATION
AND MAINTENANCE
</p>
<p>The degradation of natural resources can occur, not just by the action of
</p>
<p>pollutants but also by improper resource utilisation practices.
</p>
<p>Soil erosion and desertification: The development of the fertile top-soil
</p>
<p>takes centuries. But, it can be removed very easily due to human activities
</p>
<p>like over-cultivation, unrestricted grazing, deforestation and poor
</p>
<p>irrigation practices, resulting in arid patches of land. When large barren
</p>
<p>patches extend and meet over time, a desert is created. Internationally, it
</p>
<p>has been recognised that desertification is a major problem nowadays,
</p>
<p>particularly due to increased urbanisation.
</p>
<p>Waterlogging and soil salinity: Irrigation without proper drainage of
</p>
<p>water leads to waterlogging in the soil. Besides affecting the crops,
</p>
<p>waterlogging draws salt to the surface of the soil. The salt then is deposited
</p>
<p>as a thin crust on the land surface or starts collecting at the roots of the
</p>
<p>plants. This increased salt content is inimical to the growth of crops and
</p>
<p>is extremely damaging to agriculture. Waterlogging and soil salinity are
</p>
<p>some of the problems that have come in the wake of the Green Revolution.
</p>
<p>16.9 DEFORESTATION
</p>
<p>Deforestation is the conversion of forested areas to non-forested ones.
</p>
<p>According to an estimate, almost 40 per cent forests have been lost in the
</p>
<p>tropics, compared to only 1 per cent in the temperate region. The present
</p>
<p>scenario of deforestation is particularly grim in India. At the beginning of
</p>
<p>2015-16</p>
<p/>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>284
</p>
<p>BIOLOGY
</p>
<p>the twentieth century, forests covered about 30 per cent of the land of
</p>
<p>India. By the end of the century, it shrunk to 19.4 per cent, whereas the
</p>
<p>National Forest Policy (1988) of India has recommended 33 per cent forest
</p>
<p>cover for the plains and 67 per cent for the hills.
</p>
<p>How does deforestation occur? A number of human activities
</p>
<p>contribute to it. One of the major reasons is the conversion of forest to
</p>
<p>agricultural land so as to feed the growing human population. Trees are
</p>
<p>axed for timber, firewood, cattle ranching and for several other purposes.
</p>
<p>Slash and burn agriculture, commonly called as Jhum cultivation in
</p>
<p>the north-eastern states of India, has also contributed to deforestation.
</p>
<p>In slash and burn agriculture, the farmers cut down the trees of the forest
</p>
<p>and burn the plant remains. The ash is used as a fertiliser and the land is
</p>
<p>then used for farming or cattle grazing. After cultivation, the area is left
</p>
<p>for several years so as to allow its recovery. The farmers then move on to
</p>
<p>other areas and repeat this process. In earlier days, when Jhum cultivation
</p>
<p>was in prevalence, enough time-gap was given such that the land recovered
</p>
<p>from the effect of cultivation. With increasing population, and repeated
</p>
<p>cultivation, this recovery phase is done away with, resulting in
</p>
<p>deforestation.
</p>
<p>What are the consequences of deforestation? One of the major effects
</p>
<p>is enhanced carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere because
</p>
<p>trees that could hold a lot of carbon in their biomass are lost with
</p>
<p>deforestation. Deforestation also causes loss of biodiversity due to habitat
</p>
<p>destruction, disturbs hydrologic cycle, causes soil erosion, and may lead
</p>
<p>to desertification in extreme cases.
</p>
<p>Reforestation is the process of restoring a forest that once existed
</p>
<p>but was removed at some point of time in the past. Reforestation may
</p>
<p>occur naturally in a deforested area. However, we can speed it up by
</p>
<p>planting trees with due consideration to biodiversity that earlier existed
</p>
<p>in that area.
</p>
<p>16.9.1 Case Study of Peopleâ€™s Participation in
Conservation of Forests
</p>
<p>Peopleâ€™s participation has a long history in India. In 1731, the king of
</p>
<p>Jodhpur in Rajasthan asked one of his ministers to arrange wood for
</p>
<p>constructing a new palace. The minister and workers went to a forest
</p>
<p>near a village, inhabited by Bishnois, to cut down trees. The Bishnoi
</p>
<p>community is known for its peaceful co-existence with nature. The effort
</p>
<p>to cut down trees by the kings was thwarted by the Bishnois. A Bishnoi
</p>
<p>woman Amrita Devi showed exemplary courage by hugging a tree and
</p>
<p>daring kingâ€™s men to cut her first before cutting the tree. The tree mattered
</p>
<p>much more to her than her own life. Sadly, the kingâ€™s men did not heed to
</p>
<p>her pleas, and cut down the tree along with Amrita Devi. Her three
</p>
<p>daughters and hundreds of other Bishnois followed her, and thus lost
</p>
<p>their lives saving trees. Nowhere in history do we find a commitment of

<p>ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES
</p>
<p>SUMMARY
</p>
<p>Major issues relating to environmental pollution and depletion of
</p>
<p>valuable natural resources vary in dimension from local, regional to
</p>
<p>global levels. Air pollution primarily results from burning of fossil fuel,
</p>
<p>e.g., coal and petroleum, in industries and in automobiles. They are
</p>
<p>harmful to humans, animals and plants, and therefore must be removed
</p>
<p>to keep our air clean. Domestic sewage, the most common source of
</p>
<p>pollution of water bodies, reduces dissolved oxygen but increases
</p>
<p>biochemical oxygen demand of receiving water. Domestic sewage is rich
</p>
<p>in nutrients, especially, nitrogen and phosphorus, which cause
</p>
<p>eutrophication and nuisance algal blooms. Industrial waste waters are
</p>
<p>often rich in toxic chemicals, especially heavy metals and organic
</p>
<p>compounds. Industrial waste waters harm living organisms. Municipal
</p>
<p>solid wastes also create problems and must be disposed off in landfills.
</p>
<p>Disposal of hazardous wastes like defunct ships, radioactive wastes
</p>
<p>and e-wastes requires additional efforts. Soil pollution primarily results
</p>
<p>from agricultural chemicals (e.g., pesticides) and leachates from solid
</p>
<p>wastes deposited over it.
</p>
<p>Two major environmental issues of global nature are increasing
</p>
<p>greenhouse effect, which is warming Earth, and depletion of ozone in
</p>
<p>the stratosphere. Enhanced greenhouse effect is mainly due to
</p>
<p>increased emission of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and CFCs.,
</p>
<p>and also due to deforestation. It may drastically change rainfall pattern,
</p>
<p>global temperature, besides deleteriously affecting living organisms.
</p>
<p>Ozone in the stratosphere, which protects us from harmful effects of
</p>
<p>ultraviolet radiation, is depleting fast due to emission of CFCs thus
</p>
<p>increasing the risks of skin cancer, mutation and other disorders.
</p>
<p>this magnitude when human beings sacrificed their lives for the cause of
</p>
<p>the environment. The Government of India has recently instituted the
</p>
<p>Amrita Devi Bishnoi Wildlife Protection Award for individuals or
</p>
<p>communities from rural areas that have shown extraordinary courage
</p>
<p>and dedication in protecting wildlife.
</p>
<p>You may have heard of the Chipko Movement of Garhwal Himalayas.
</p>
<p>In 1974, local women showed enormous bravery in protecting trees from
</p>
<p>the axe of contractors by hugging them. People all over the world have
</p>
<p>acclaimed the Chipko movement.
</p>
<p>Realising the significance of participation by local communities,
</p>
<p>the Government of India in 1980s has introduced the concept of
</p>
<p>Joint Forest Management (JFM) so as to work closely with the local
</p>
<p>communities for protecting and managing forests. In return for their
</p>
<p>services to the forest, the communities get benefit of various forest products
</p>
<p>(e.g., fruits, gum, rubber, medicine, etc.), and thus the forest can be
</p>
<p>conserved in a sustainable manner.
